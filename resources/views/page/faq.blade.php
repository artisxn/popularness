            <p>Really!? Did you seriously just click on this question? Of course you can! It's
                what fuels this site and keeps the artists in tune with the impact of their
                videos on the world. See music videos are pretty unique, they aren't dictated by
                dollars or programmers (like at radio stations). So when a fan watches the
                videos they actually like to watch without dictatorship, it gives the artist
                tremendous insight on their effect. So continue to share and share and share
                discoveries with your friends and family.</p></p>

                best suit your needs, creating an account, and uploading your videos to your
                Video Library. Once your video has been uploaded it's always wise to give as
                much detail about that video as possible. Initially, your video will be pending.
                Once we approve your video, we will send you an email giving you the heads up
                that your video is now posted on the site. If for some strange reason your video
                is rejected, we will also send you an email explainging why it was rejected and
                the steps needed to take to resolve the issue.</p></p>
